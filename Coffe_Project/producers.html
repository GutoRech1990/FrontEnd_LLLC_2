        <h1>The World's Largest Coffee Producers</h1>
        <p>
            Coffee is one of the most consumed beverages on the planet, cultivated in diverse regions around the globe,
            especially in countries located along the tropical belt. Coffee production is a crucial part of many
            countries'
            economies, and global demand for this beverage drives the development of vast coffee-growing areas on
            different
            continents. Let’s explore the world's largest coffee producers, learning about their unique characteristics,
            agricultural practices, and the role they play in the global industry.
        </p>

        <div class="flag">
            <h2>1. Brazil: The Coffee Giant</h2>
            <img src="./Images/brasil.webp" alt="">
            <p>
                Brazil is by far the largest coffee producer in the world, accounting for about 40% of global
                production, an
                impressive dominance that has been established over more than a century. Coffee cultivation in Brazil
                began in
                the 18th century, and today coffee plantations cover vast areas in the states of Minas Gerais, São
                Paulo,
                Espírito Santo, and Bahia.
            </p>
            <p>
                Brazil primarily cultivates the Arabica and Robusta (known locally as Conilon) varieties. Arabica
                coffee,
                valued for its smooth and complex flavor, is the main product of Brazilian farms. Robusta, on the other
                hand,
                is more resilient to pests and climate changes, and is widely used for instant coffee and stronger
                blends.
            </p>
            <p>
                A distinctive feature of Brazilian coffee is its diverse flavor profiles, which vary by growing region.
                In
                Minas Gerais, for example, coffee often has chocolate and nutty notes, while in Espírito Santo, where
                Robusta
                predominates, the profile is more full-bodied and bitter. The combination of climate, soil, and altitude
                makes
                Brazil a rich source of different coffee styles, exporting to demanding markets like Europe, the United
                States,
                and Japan.

            <h2>2. Vietnam: The King of Robusta</h2>
            <img src="./Images/vietna.png" alt="">
            <p>
                Though many associate Vietnam with rice and tea, this Asian country is the second-largest coffee
                producer in
                the world and the largest exporter of Robusta coffee. Robusta is more bitter and has a higher caffeine
                content
                than Arabica, making it very popular for instant coffee and stronger blends. Vietnam accounts for about
                20% of
                global coffee production, making it a dominant force in the global market.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coffee was introduced to Vietnam during the French colonial period in the 19th century, and since then,
                cultivation has spread across the country, especially in the Central Highlands, where the tropical
                climate and
                altitude are ideal for coffee growing. Dak Lak, Lam Dong, and Gia Lai are some of the main production
                regions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vietnamese coffee has a stronger, more intense flavor and is often prepared in unique ways. In Vietnam,
                coffee
                is traditionally served with condensed milk, resulting in the famous Cà Phê Sữa Đá (iced coffee with
                condensed
                milk), or with eggs in the intriguing Cà Phê Trứng (egg coffee), a delicacy that surprises visitors’
                palates.

            <h2>3. Colombia: Land of High-Altitude Coffee</h2>
            <img src="./Images/colombia.png" alt="">
            <p>
                Colombia is globally renowned for producing high-quality coffee, ranking as the third-largest producer
                worldwide. The country is especially famous for its Arabica coffee, grown at high altitudes in the
                Andean
                mountains. Coffee production in Colombia dates back to the 19th century, and Colombian coffee is widely
                valued
                for its smooth and balanced notes, light acidity, and floral aroma.
            </p>
            <p>
                The regions of Antioquia, Caldas, Quindío, Risaralda, and Tolima are among the most well-known for
                Colombian
                coffee cultivation. The mild climate and altitude are crucial factors contributing to the unique quality
                of
                coffee grown in these areas. The country invests heavily in traditional harvesting methods, and most
                beans are
                still hand-picked, ensuring a more careful selection of coffee cherries.
            </p>
            <p>
                The "Café de Colombia" brand is internationally recognized, and the National Federation of Coffee
                Growers of
                Colombia plays a crucial role in promoting and ensuring the quality of coffee produced in the country.
                Thanks
                to this dedication, Colombian coffee has conquered demanding markets in countries like the United
                States,
                Germany, and Japan.

            <h2>4. Indonesia: A Diversity of Flavors</h2>
            <img src="./Images/indonesia.png" alt="">
            <p>
                Indonesia is another major coffee producer, ranking fourth worldwide. The Indonesian archipelago is
                known for
                its diversity of climates and landscapes, resulting in a wide variety of coffee flavor profiles. Coffee
                production began in the 17th century when Dutch colonizers introduced the plant to the islands of Java,
                Sumatra,
                and Sulawesi. Today, Indonesia is famous for both its Robusta and Arabica coffees.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each coffee-producing island in Indonesia has its unique characteristics. Sumatra coffee, for instance,
                is
                full-bodied and has an earthy taste, while Java coffee is smoother and more balanced. Indonesia is also
                known
                for one of the world's most expensive and exotic coffees, Kopi Luwak, produced from beans that pass
                through the
                digestive system of civets, animals that eat the coffee cherries and excrete partially digested beans.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although controversial due to animal welfare concerns, Kopi Luwak remains a curiosity in the coffee
                world and
                contributes to Indonesia's unique reputation as a country of great coffee diversity.

            <h2>5. Ethiopia: The Birthplace of Coffee</h2>
            <img src="./Images/etiopia.png" alt="">
            <p>
                Ethiopia is considered the birthplace of coffee, as it was here that the Coffea arabica plant was
                discovered.
                Coffee production in Ethiopia is an intrinsic part of its culture and economy, and the country is the
                fifth
                largest producer of Arabica coffee worldwide. The forests in the Sidamo, Yirgacheffe, and Harar regions
                are
                famous for producing some of the most cherished and exotic coffees in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ethiopian coffee is widely praised for its complex, floral flavor, with notes that can range from citrus
                fruits
                to flowers, depending on the region and processing method. A unique cultural practice in Ethiopia is the
                "coffee
                ceremony," a traditional ritual where coffee is roasted, ground, and prepared in front of guests,
                symbolizing
                hospitality and respect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coffee cultivation and processing methods in Ethiopia are highly traditional, and many farms operate as
                "coffee
                gardens," where small areas are planted around homes and villages. This artisanal approach helps
                preserve the
                unique quality of Ethiopian coffee, which is widely exported to demanding markets in Europe and North
                America.

        <h2>Other Major Producers</h2>
        <p>
            In addition to these coffee giants, other countries also play a significant role in the global industry.
            Honduras,
            Peru, Uganda, and Mexico are major producers contributing to the variety of coffees available in the global
            market. Each of these countries brings its own cultivation methods, climate characteristics, and cultural
            traditions, further enriching the global coffee scene.
