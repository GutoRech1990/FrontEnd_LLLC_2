        Macintosh, commonly known as Mac, is Apple's line of personal computers that use the company's proprietary macOS
        operating system. Personal computers were Apple's original business line, but as of the end of 2023 they account
        for
        only about eight percent of the company's revenue.[1]
        There are six Macintosh computer families in production:
        iMac: Consumer all-in-one desktop computer, introduced in 1998.
        Mac Mini: Consumer sub-desktop computer, introduced in 2005.
        MacBook Pro: Professional notebook, introduced in 2006.
        Mac Pro: Professional workstation, introduced in 2006.
        MacBook Air: Consumer ultra-thin notebook, introduced in 2008.
        Mac Studio: Professional small form-factor workstation, introduced in 2022.
        Often described as a walled garden, Macs use Apple silicon chips, run the macOS operating system, and include
        Apple
        software like the Safari web browser, iMovie for home movie editing, GarageBand for music creation, and the
        iWork
        productivity suite. Apple also sells pro apps: Final Cut Pro for video production, Logic Pro for musicians and
        producers, and Xcode for software developers. Apple also sells a variety of accessories for Macs, including the
        Pro
        Display XDR, Apple Studio Display, Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard.

        The iPhone is Apple's line of smartphones, which run the iOS operating system. The first iPhone was unveiled by
        Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, new models have been released every year. When it was introduced, its
        multi-touch screen was described as "revolutionary" and a "game-changer" for the mobile phone industry. The
        device
        has been credited with creating the app economy.
        iOS is one of the two largest smartphone platforms in the world alongside Android. The iPhone has generated
        large
        profits for the company, and is credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly
        traded
        companies.[178] As of the end of 2023, the iPhone accounts for more than half of the company's revenue.[1]

        The iPad is mainly marketed for consuming multimedia, creating art, working on documents, videoconferencing, and
        playing games. The iPad lineup consists of several base iPad models, and the smaller iPad Mini, upgraded iPad
        Air,
        and high-end iPad Pro. Apple has consistently improved the iPad's performance, with the iPad Pro adopting the
        same
        M1 and M2 chips as the Mac; but the iPad still receives criticism for its limited OS.[179][180]
        As of September 2020, Apple has sold more than 500 million iPads, though sales peaked in 2013.[181] The iPad
        still

        percent of the company's revenue as of the end of 2023.[1] Apple sells several iPad accessories, including the
        Apple
        Pencil, Smart Keyboard, Smart Keyboard Folio, Magic Keyboard, and several adapters.
