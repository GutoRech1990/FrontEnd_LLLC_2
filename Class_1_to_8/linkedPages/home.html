        Apple Inc. is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered and incorporated in
        Cupertino, California, in Silicon Valley. It is best known for its consumer electronics, software, and services.
        The
        company was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc. by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1977. As of 2023, Apple is
        the
        largest technology company by revenue, with US$394.33 billion.

        The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its second computer, the
        Apple
        II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and
        the
        Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985,
        internal
        company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrew to other ventures; John Sculley
        served
        as long-time CEO for a decade. In the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share in the personal computer
        industry
        to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones. In
        1997,
        Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy. To resolve its failed operating system strategy, it bought NeXT,
        effectively
        bringing Jobs back to the company, who guided Apple back to profitability over the next decade with the
        introductions of the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad devices to critical acclaim as well as the iTunes Store,
        launching
        the "Think different" campaign, and opening the Apple Store retail chain. These moves elevated Apple to
        consistently
        be one of the world's most valuable brands since about 2010. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died
        two
        months later; he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.

        Apple's current product lineup includes portable and home hardware such as the iPhone, Apple Watch, Mac and
        Apple
        TV; operating systems such as iOS and macOS; and various software and services including Apple Pay, iCloud, and
        multimedia streaming services like Apple Music and Apple TV+. Apple is one of the Big Five American information
        technology companies;[a] for the most part since 2011,[b] Apple has been the world's largest company by market
        capitalization, and, as of 2023, is the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales, the largest
        manufacturing company by revenue, and the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world.

        Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in 2018, and, as of June
        2024,
        is valued at just over $3.2 trillion. It has received criticism regarding its contractors' labor practices, its
        relationship with trade unions, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive
        practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of
        brand
        loyalty.
